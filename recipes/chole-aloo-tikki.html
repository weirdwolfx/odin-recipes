            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and peel.</li>

            <li>Oil your hands with a little vegetable oil and divide the potato mixture into 4 equal portions. Pat each portion into a potato patty about 1/3-inch
            thick.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry potato cakes until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>

            <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in red chile peppers, cumin, bay leaves. Add onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add pepper-clove mixture, curry powder, and 
            turmeric.</li>
            <li>Mix tomato paste with water. Stir diluted tomato paste and tomato into the skillet. Cook over medium heat until the tomato has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.</li>
